
# React App with Modular Components

This project is a modular React application featuring a clean and responsive design. The app incorporates multiple components for seamless navigation and content display.

## Project Structure

The project includes the following key components:

- **Header**: Displays the navigation bar and branding.
- **ActivityZone**: Highlights the main interactive zone for activities.
- **Modules**: Showcases modular content or features of the app.
- **ImagesSection**: A section dedicated to displaying images dynamically.
- **Footer**: Contains footer information and links.
- **Over (Optional)**: Additional content or overlay (currently commented out in `App.js`).

## Getting Started

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14+ recommended)
- npm or yarn package manager

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

### Running the App

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the app.

## Customization
